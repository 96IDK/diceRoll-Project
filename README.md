# diceRoll-Project
The "diceRoll" Java program is a console-based game. Players roll a virtual six-sided dice to earn points. Rolling a 6 ends the game, 4 earns no points, others add one point. Aim for at least 3 points to win. Simple rules, console interaction, and luck-based challenge make it engaging.
